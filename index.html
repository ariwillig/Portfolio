                    <p>
                        I have always been extremely interested in the mechanics of heart function and how electrical signals contribute to keeping us alive.
                        Building out a pacemaker from scratch taught me how to integrate operational amplifiers, filtering circuitry, C++ programming, 
                        and bluetooth communication devices all in one medical device. Testing the pacemaker on ECGs and frog anatomy allowed me to refine the design
                        and eventually create a fully functional pacemaker that induced heartbeats in response to electrical failure of the organ. The pacemaker was also
                        able to send data out to a bluetooth device (my iPhone) and record past measurements.

                    <h2>Mercury Project</h2>
                    <p>
                        Methylmercury (MeHg) poisoning is a pressing global threat to human health. In past global health crises, methylmercury 
                        poisoning outbreaks have taken hundreds of lives and left millions with persistent neurodevelopmental symptoms. 
                        The heavy metal is not only lethal in high doses, but can also cause debilitating neurological, cardiovascular, liver, and kidney damage.
                        Along with a team of classmates, I developed a model to monitor the mass flow rates, accumulation, 
                        and transformation of methylmercury and its derivatives across both a healthy and unhealthy chronic 60-day dosage period. This model used a
                        simplified version of the most endangered organs and substantial systems of differential equations to reproduce the accumulation of
                        methylmercury across the human body.

                    <h2>Lightbox</h2>
                    <p>
                        A lightbox, while not being unbelievably complex, integrates all of the main components of medical device prototyping.
                        A few months back I designed a lightbox in three parts, a CAD model, PCB design and soldering, and firmware integration.
                        Though I have extensive experience in CAD through past internships and courses at Duke University, modeling Bert from Sesame Street
                        was a fun little design and I thouroughly enjoyed it. Designing a PCB from scratch using KiCad and being able to solder electrical components 
                        and an Arduino to it was challenging but an amazing learning experience. Finally, integrating software with the arduino allowed me to learn
                        about state machines and see the project come to life. The final product was a lightbox that used firmware to control three LEDs independently,
                        controlling their pulse durations and brightness with potentiometers soldered into the PCB.

                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are extremely versatile programming languages used across the entire internet in a plethora of ways.
                        Teaching myself these languages to build this website from scratch was extremely fun and I now feel very proficient in using
                        these languages together. Using HTML to define and build out the structure for the site, CSS to style it and implement what I
                        had envisioned, and JavaScript to add in functionality and finishing touches resulted in what you are seeing right now!
